Ethico – AI Behavioural UX & Dark Pattern Analyzer

Ethico is an AI-powered UX audit and trust-compliance platform that detects dark patterns, deceptive design practices, and behavioral manipulation from screenshots or live URLs. It identifies cognitive bias exploitation, checks regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA, FTC), and generates ethical redesign recommendations that preserve trust without sacrificing conversion.

Ethico is built to help product teams design responsibly, reduce legal risk, and build long-term user trust at scale.

Unintentional dark patterns in UX
